the following problem fixed:
- For real-time PPP, v.2.4.1 comply with RTCM 3 SSR draft version (April 12, 2010)
  for corrections. The RTCM recently has published the final version as Amendment
  5 [1], which changed several message formats from the draft. If SSR corrections
  comply with Amendment 5, PPP is not enabled due to the imcompatibility of
  correction message formats.
  [1] RTCM Standard 10403.1 - Amendment 5, Differential GNSS (Global Navigation 
      Satellite Systems) Services - version 3, July 1, 2011
